## Cameras
There are 3 different camera controllers provided in raylib-extras. Each one is intended to show an example of a different way to move the camera around a scene.

### rlFPCamera
This is a first person camera. It uses the traditional mouse and WASD keys for movement. It provides position and view angle data back to the calling application.
See csamples/rlFPCamera_sample for a simple use case.
